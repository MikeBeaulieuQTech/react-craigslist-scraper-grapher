# React Craigslist Price Scraper and Grapher

A fullstack MERN app that will take a term and search Craigslist Los Angeles, scrape the data (does not use an API), graph the results within a React framework, and save it in a Mongo DB.

Prices are graphed on the Y axis. Hovering over a bar will bring up the title of the ad. Clicking on an individual bar will take you to that Craigslist ad.

## Simple is beautiful
