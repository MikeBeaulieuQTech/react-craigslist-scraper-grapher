# React Craigslist Price Scraper and Grapher

A fullstack MERN app that scrapes Craigslist Los Angeles (does not use an API), graphs the results within a React framework, and saves it to a Mongo DB. Favorites can be selectively viewed. Searches can be updated.

Prices are graphed on the Y axis. Hovering over a bar will bring up the title of the ad. Clicking on an individual bar will take you to that Craigslist ad.

## Simple is beautiful
